         ### Summary of our main tasks done to use Streamlit /GitHub
            - we prepared the data set to gain some memory
            - we select the road accident from 2012-2015
            - we kept road accident 2016 seperately to compare with our prediction
            - we did run the classification non-linear models: GBC - RFC - KNN - SVC - (XGBOOST?)
            - EDA and Dataviz are using road accidents from 2012 to 2016

France, like many other countries, strives to enhance road safety and reduce the severity of accidents. To achieve this goal, harnessing the power of data science methods has become increasingly important. By utilizing data-driven approaches, we can gain valuable insights into the factors contributing to the severity of road accidents in France. We believe that machine learning and deep learning are good tools to reduce or prevent road accidents by applying preventive actions using AI solutions."}</p><br>', unsafe_allow_html=True)

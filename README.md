# Infinite Number Calculator
This Infinite Number Calculator was created to support the paper titled "Representations of Infinite Numbers in a Decimal Number System". 
The calulator interprets given numbers in Infinite Number Notation, performs and displays repeating calculations, then condenses the results to provide output in starting notation.

The calculator takes six inputs: Iterations to Show, two numbers, the operation, and Relative Repetitions for each number. 

25-50 iterations have been sufficient to reveal consistent patterns. More may be needed for operations between more complex numbers.

The two numbers can be any number expressed with digits. Numbers with repeating digit sets are expressed with parenthesis around the digit set.
  Ex: 1.(3) = 1.3333...; (4)9 = ...4444449

Acceptable operations include '+' (addition), '-' (subtraction), '*' (multiplication), '/' (division), '//' (integer division), '%' (modulo), '^' (exponent), '=' (comparison)

Relative Repetitions allow specifying relative value between numbers with the same digits. Unless a specific number is sought to be used, keeping both RR at zero would be best for initial calculations. The results of each calculation display their RR, which can be used to ensure consistency if then using the result of one operation as an input for another.

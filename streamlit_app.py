# Abnormal Heartbeat Classification

Detection of normal vs abnormal heartbeats in humans. Then algorithm will be applied to canines based on accuracy.

There are two columns with the last column being either a 0 (normal) or a 1 (abnormal). 

# Arrhythmia Dataset
Number of Samples: 109446
Number of Categories: 5
Sampling Frequency: 125Hz
Data Source: Physionet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset
Classes: ['N': 0, 'S': 1, 'V': 2, 'F': 3, 'Q': 4]

# The PTB Diagnostic ECG Database
Number of Samples: 14552
Number of Categories: 2
Sampling Frequency: 125Hz
Data Source: Physionet's PTB Diagnostic Database

All the samples are cropped, downsampled and padded with zeroes if necessary to the fixed dimension of 188.

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:
"""


with st.echo(code_location='below'):
    total_points = st.slider("Number of points in spiral", 1, 5000, 2000)
    num_turns = st.slider("Number of turns in spiral", 1, 100, 9)

    Point = namedtuple('Point', 'x y')
    data = []

    points_per_turn = total_points / num_turns

    for curr_point_num in range(total_points):
        curr_turn, i = divmod(curr_point_num, points_per_turn)
        angle = (curr_turn + 1) * 2 * math.pi * i / points_per_turn
        radius = curr_point_num / total_points
        x = radius * math.cos(angle)
        y = radius * math.sin(angle)
        data.append(Point(x, y))

    st.altair_chart(alt.Chart(pd.DataFrame(data), height=500, width=500)
        .mark_circle(color='#0068c9', opacity=0.5)
        .encode(x='x:Q', y='y:Q'))

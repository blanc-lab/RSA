    # Gathering the Data
    # ==================================

    # We are going to pull apart each type of "like" you can receive on the app from the
    # messy JSON file that Hinge sends us.
    # Basically, the logic I'm using is as follows:
    #
    # - If "like" is not null, and "match" is not null, then this is where we sent a like and got a match.
    # - If "like" is not null, and "match" is null, then this is where we sent a like and got no match.
    # - If "match" is not null, and "like" is null, then this is where we received a like and got a match.
    # - If "match" is null, and "like" is null, then this is where we redeived a like but did not match.

    # Get data

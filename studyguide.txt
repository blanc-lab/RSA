Which of these is NOT true about Big O notation?
1. The letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as order of the function.
2. It is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
3. In mathematics, it is commonly used to describe how closely a finite series approximates a given function.
4. A description of a function in terms of big O notation usually provides the most accurate value of the function.

Why is it important to initialize variables?
1. You want all your variables to start with a value of 0 (zero) so you can add things to them later.
2. You don't want to think about what value each variable needs to start out with.
3. Depending on the machine or compiler you are using, you cannot assume the value a variable contains without initializing it.
4. You need to decide on the type of data you are using but not the initial value.

What is interpreted code?
         1. A code file is translated into machine code before it is executed.  This machine code is stored in a separate executable file that can be run later.
         2. Each line of code is translated into the home language of the user, so that commands such as if, for, print, etc. are in the correct language.
         3. Each line of code is translated into machine code (1's and 0's) and executed using any input data given. This process is repeated for each line of code in the program.
         4. Each line of code is reviewed by an engineer for errors.  Once the code has been corrected it is referred to as "interpreted."
